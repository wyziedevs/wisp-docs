Beyond `cx.login`, `cx.user` and sessions. Everything here is opt-in: an app that calls none of it carries none of it, and no request pays for it.

## Roles and CORS

```rust
let admin = cx.need(&USERS, |u| u.admin)?;   // Row<User>
```

Signed out is `cx.user`'s error (303 to sign in, 401 for a JSON client); signed in but not allowed is a 403.

```rust
fn before(cx: &mut Cx) -> Result {
    cx.cors("*")?;           // or "https://app.example.com https://x.com"
    Ok(())
}
```

A preflight is answered with a 204 and the headers, carried as the `Err` that `?` returns. A site not listed gets no `access-control-allow-origin`.

## Signed tokens (reset, verify, magic link)

```rust
let t = wisp::token("reset", &user.id, Duration::from_secs(3600));
let id: u64 = wisp::untoken("reset", &t)?;   // 400 for any failure, the same one
```

- HMAC-SHA256 under `WISP_SECRET` (and `WISP_SECRET_OLD`) over purpose, payload and expiry. A purpose of `""` is none.
- The payload is readable, not forgeable; keep secrets out of it.
- A token works until it expires: for a reset, put something in it that changes when it is used (the password hash's first bytes) and compare.

## Two-factor codes

```rust
let secret = wisp::totp::secret();                       // keep with the user
let uri = wisp::totp::uri("My App", &user.email, &secret); // QR code or text
wisp::totp::check(&user.totp, &code)                     // ±1 step (30 s)
wisp::totp::check_step(..)                               // the step, to refuse a replay
```

RFC 6238, SHA-1, six digits. Six digits can be guessed: put a `RateLimit` on the check, by user.

## Outbound HTTP

```rust
let mut req = wisp::Request::new("POST", "https://api.example.com/rows");
req.header("authorization", &format!("Bearer {key}"));
req.body = json.into_bytes();
let reply = wisp::fetch(req).await?;      // reply.status, reply.text()
```

- `http://` works as is. `https://` needs the `tls` feature (`wisp = { version = "..", features = ["tls"] }`: rustls and the web's root certificates, no OpenSSL).
- One request per connection, no redirects, 30 s, 16 MB. Errors name the host only.
- In the edge build it is the host's `fetch`.
- A URL a visitor chose is for the app to check before calling.

## Email
Not built in: send mail from an action with `wisp::fetch` or any HTTP client.

## Sign in with GitHub, Google or OpenID Connect

```rust
// src/routes/auth/github/+server.rs
fn get(cx: &mut Cx) -> Result { wisp::oauth::github().start(cx) }

// src/routes/auth/github/callback/+server.rs
async fn get(cx: &mut Cx) -> Result {
    let who = wisp::oauth::github().finish(cx).await?;   // id, email (verified only), name
    let id = match USERS.find(|u| u.github == who.id) { Some(u) => u.id, None => /* sign up */ };
    cx.sign_in(id);
    redirect("/")
}
```

- Keys: `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` (`GOOGLE_...`, and `{NAME}_...` for `oidc(name, issuer).await?`), or `.keys(id, secret)`.
- Register `{ORIGIN}/auth/github/callback` with the provider; set `ORIGIN` in production, or use `.redirect(url)`.

Kept safe by:
- a random `state` in a signed 10-minute cookie, used up by the first callback and compared in constant time;
- PKCE (S256); the secret only in the POST body to an `https` endpoint; no key or token in any error or log;
- only a provider-verified email returned (match accounts on `id`, not email, unless you want a sign-in to join an existing account);
- every failure the same 400.

## Not here
Distributed `RateLimit` waits for the relay (S2). Automatic `/_wisp/oauth/...` routes need `http.rs`; the two small routes above do the same. SMTP, SES.
